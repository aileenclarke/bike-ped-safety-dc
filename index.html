                <div class="center main-text">
                    <p>I researched the dataset further and found a number of significant caveats. MPD officers report to the scene 
                        of a crash and complete the crash report form. This report is completed and published to the dataset each week. 
                        However, the crash report is not updated. If a victim dies hours, days, or even months later that isn't updated 
                        in this data set. Additionally, MPD officers decide whether or not to call the Major Crash Unit based on the 
                        observable severity of injuries at the scene. Finally, not all crashes are mapped correctly or mapped at all.

                    <p>To the city's credit, they were upfront with these caveats. However, on the same page where they list these caveats, 
                        they also state that the purpose of the dataset is to “provide crash location data  to users interested in exploring 
                        spatial patterns and creating maps in support of safety analysis.” Since I was focused on traffic violence involving 
                        pedestrians and cyclists, I couldn't afford to use a dataset  that was missing so many confirmed incidents. </p>

                    <p>Now I was confronting a new problem. More data than ever is available for us to download and use. This is a double edged 
                        sword. No dataset is perfect, so how do we decide what is good enough? The choice has implications on analysis and 
                        storytelling. Do we not tell a story because the data isn't perfect? Do we move forward knowing the conclusions we 
                        draw may leave something out?</p>
